In our data set we have information on each customer's educational status, marital status, job, whether they have a housing loan or a personal loan, if they default on thier credit. It also includes contact frequency information regarding when they were contacted by the bank such as their last contact day and month, how they were contacted, how long did their contact last(in seconds), as well as the amount of days that have passed since their last contact.\n",
